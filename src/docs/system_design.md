# System Design: SAAQclic Alternative Site

## Guiding Principles
- **Open Source:** All technologies must be open source, widely adopted, and well-maintained.
- **Proven & Safe:** Use only established, production-tested libraries and frameworks.
- **Maintainability:** Prioritize clear architecture and documentation.
- **Security:** Follow best practices for authentication, data handling, and deployment.
- **Accessibility & Bilingual Support:** Meet accessibility standards and support both French and English.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend:** Modern web application (SPA or MPA)
- **Backend:** RESTful API server
- **Database:** Relational database (SQL)
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment
- **Hosting:** Cloud or on-premises with HTTPS support

## Technology Choices

### Frontend
- **Framework:** [React](https://react.dev/) (or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as an alternative)
    - Rationale: Both are open source, have large communities, and are used in production globally.
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (for React)
- **Styling:** [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for accessibility and responsiveness
- **Internationalization:** [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) or [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/)
- **Accessibility:** Use built-in ARIA support and [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)

### Backend
- **Language:** [Java](https://www.java.com/) (existing codebase), or [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for REST APIs
    - Rationale: Java and Spring Boot are industry standards for robust, maintainable, and secure backend services.
- **Testing:** [JUnit](https://junit.org/), [ApprovalTests.Java](https://approvaltests.com/)
- **Authentication:** [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) (supports OAuth2, JWT, etc.)
- **Email/SMS:** Integrate with [Apache Commons Email](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/) or external providers (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid) via secure APIs

### Database
- **Primary:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (preferred), or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
    - Rationale: Both are open source, reliable, and widely used in government and enterprise.
- **ORM:** [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) (integrates with Spring Boot)

### DevOps & CI/CD
- **Build:** [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (Java), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (frontend)
- **CI:** [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for local development and deployment
- **Testing:** Automated test suites for both frontend and backend

### Hosting & Deployment
- **Cloud:** [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) or on-premises
- **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS everywhere ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for certificates)
- **Monitoring:** [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for metrics

## Security Best Practices
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Store passwords securely (hashed & salted)
- Follow OWASP Top 10 for web security
- Regularly update dependencies

## Accessibility & Bilingual Support
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
- Provide full French and English language support
