  - Enables personal dashboards and private data.

- [ ] **User Dashboard**
  - Personalized dashboard showing user information and available actions.

- [ ] **Service Selection Page**
  - List and describe available services (e.g., renew license, pay fees).
  - Each service links to its own workflow.

- [ ] **Basic Service Workflow (e.g., License Renewal)**
  - Implement a single, core service workflow end-to-end.
  - Includes form input, validation, and confirmation.

- [ ] **Payment Integration (Mock or Real)**
