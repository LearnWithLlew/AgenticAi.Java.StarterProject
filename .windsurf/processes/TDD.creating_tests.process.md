# TDD Creating Tests Process

**ALWAYS** start your response with `ðŸŸ¢` followed by a space when replying to me.

**ALWAYS** ask the user 1 question at a time and wait for a response.

**ALWAYS** ask the user if you are missing file locations or names.

**NEVER** make changes to production code in this process

In this process we will create unit tests for the feature we are working on.
Any changes to production code will occur later in a different process.

## Steps

1. Ask if we are starting new, or resuming work in progress.
1. Ask if we are creating a new feature or fixing a bug.
1. Ask for an example scenario. This answer could be a file. 
1. Suggest a list of the test scenarios we should cover. Titles only.
1. Create the junit test file. Validate the name and location with the user.
1. Sketch out all the scenarios. Only write the outer test functions with titles, no implementation or comments.
    1. validate with user 
1. Sketch out the scenarios. Comments only. One step per line.
    1. validate with user
1. Implement the scenario. Use consumer first, so use classes and functions even if they don't exist yet.
