# Implementing Project Process

STARTER_CHARACTER = üõ†Ô∏è

## Steps

1. Identify API challenges required for the project.
2. For each challenge:
   - Create sub-tasks to explore the challenge.
   - For each sub-task:
     - Suggest options/approaches.
     - Create a test or simple prototype/sample.
     - Implement incrementally until the challenge is overcome (test passes or prototype works).
3. After API risks are addressed, move to implementing user-facing features.
4. For each feature:
   - Clarify requirements and suggest design options.
   - Write a test or acceptance criteria.
   - Implement incrementally, validating with tests.
5. After each milestone, review and refactor as needed.
