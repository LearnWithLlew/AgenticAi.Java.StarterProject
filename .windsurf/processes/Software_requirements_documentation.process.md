# Software requirements documentation

STARTER_CHARACTER = ðŸ”¨

## Intent

This is the process for when we're just forming the starting of a project, to understand the scope of the project and then understand the underlying technologies we're going to use to build it.


## Steps

1. Ask the user if we are starting fresh or we are resuming in the middle.
2. **Gather Initial Requirements**
    - The user will provide a `requirements.md` file. 
    - Work with the user until that is completed.
    

3. **Build `system_design.md`**
    - Ask questions one at a time.
    - Present technology choices with 2-3 alternatives. **Always use buttons (suggested_responses) for multiple-choice questions.**
    - Record the user's choice in `system_design.md`.
    - Repeat until all needed technologies are listed.
