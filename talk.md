# Title: *.process.md: Teaching AI New Tricks

## Abstract

This presentation explores the innovative use of `.process.md` files to customize and direct AI coding assistants like Cascade. We'll delve into how these markdown-based instruction sets act as "playbooks," enabling developers to codify specific workflows, enforce best practices, and teach the AI nuanced, context-aware behaviors for various development tasks. Discover how `.process.md` files transform AI assistants from general-purpose tools into highly specialized and effective pair programming partners, enhancing productivity and code quality through structured, repeatable processes.
