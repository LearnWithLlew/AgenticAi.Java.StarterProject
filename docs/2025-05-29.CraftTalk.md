## Craft 2025 Talk: Using Process Files in Agentic AI

Today, I gave a talk on how to use process files in agentic AI.
We decided to 'wing it' for the demonstration, picking a project on the fly.
The initial idea was a first-person shooter in JavaScript.
However, I guided the audience towards using Java instead.
We didn't delve deeply into coding.
The main focus was on defining the project, creating a process file to outline the project's structure and steps, and then using that process file to guide the project's development.
It had a somewhat recursive feel, using the process file to define the process of defining the project.

**What surprised me:**
- Honestly, that any of it worked, given the live, 'winged-it' nature of the demonstration.

**What went well:**
- We managed to generate a few lines of Java code, even if they didn't have any specific functionality yet.
- We successfully created a process file.
- I quite like the process file we created; I might reuse it in the future.

**Progress made:**
- We successfully initiated the beginning stages of the project.
- A to-do list was generated, which I can now follow to complete the project.

**Challenges or pain points:**
- None to report for this session.
