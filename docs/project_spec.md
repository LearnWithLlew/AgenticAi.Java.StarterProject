# Project Specification: 3D First Person Shooter Desktop App

## Brief Description

We are building a 3D first person shooter (FPS) desktop application in Java. Initially, the application will present an empty world, serving as the starting point for further development. The goal is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that establishes the core 3D environment and FPS controls, with no additional features or assets in the initial version.

## MVP Scope
- Empty 3D world
- First person camera controls
- Java desktop application

## Tech Stack
- Language: Java
- 3D Engine: Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL)
- Build Tool: Maven
- Platform: macOS

*Note: The 3D engine and build tool will be selected based on suitability for rapid prototyping and cross-platform support.*
